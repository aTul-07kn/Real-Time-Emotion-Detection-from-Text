1) Front End - created a simple webpage to take information from the user which includes name, age, location, gender, orderId and feedback for further processing.
2) Integrated the webpage with flask python framework to collect and process the data in the backend.
3) Tested Deep Learning models(Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU) to test the performance of the models while detecting the emotion from the text.
4) Created a database to store the customer data gathered from the feedback form.
